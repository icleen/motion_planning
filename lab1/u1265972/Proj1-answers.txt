Analysis: The path it took is not the shortest.  This is because the algorithm chose to prioritize looking at the left action over the up action and therefore found the goal through that action and quit instead of finding the optimal path.

Analysis: The path is not optimal because again the order in which the algorithm checks the actions prioritizes right and left and therefore just ends up going all the way right and all the way left until it finds the goal, being very un-optimal.

Analysis: Because diagonal actions are prohibited there is no path that will lead to the goal.

Because you are adding so many search nodes, you have a large stack of nodes to search and this may take a significant amount of memory.  You could cull the number of search nodes in the stack periodically to remove nodes that have been visited but this may take up time, so there is a trade-off.

Analysis: The order prioritizes up and down actions and therefore finds a different solution, albeit and equally bad solution.

Analysis: similarly we find a completely different solution however this solution happens to be slightly more optimal than the first just because search the up and down directions gets us closer to the goal faster.

Visited: Really long, so I omitted it

Analysis: It found the optimal path.  It works because although it un-optimally looks at nodes, it is restricted to looking at only paths at the depth, m, so if there is an optimal solution of length m it will find it.  If there is not, then m increases and we go again.  Therefore, when m is equal to the length of the optimal path it will find that path and therefore the optimal solution.  Guaranteed optimal solution.

Analysis: It did find the optimal path because bfs always finds the optimal path when the transition costs are equal.  This is because bfs is designed to spread out in all directions until it finds the optimal solution.  The proof is similar to idfs above.

Analysis: Again, the optimal path is found by this algorithm.

2.3
No solution is found because the path is blocked off.

2.4
DFS and BFS are equally easy to implement as you literally need to change one line of code to draw from the front of the list rather than the back (queue vs stack).  BFS is probably the cleanest because it only needs to run and look at a path once, unlike IDFS, which ends up looking at each path multiple times as you grow the maxdepth, m.  DFS will just keep going in one direction until it can't anymore, so obviously the paths evaluated are significantly different.  Thus DFS is not optimal, while both IDFS and BFS are optimal.  However, BFS is significantly faster for the same reasons it is "cleaner" (stated above).

Analysis: The path found is the lowest cost and length.  The length is guaranteed because all actions have the same cost.  The cost is guaranteed because the algorithm will only look at lowest cost paths until it finds a solution.

Analysis: We also find the optimal path here for the same reasons.  The optimal path is the lowest cost path and will also be the shortest due to equal cost transitions.
